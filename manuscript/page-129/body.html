Without losing hold of the envelope, the movement of this hand gives way to these opposite and simultaneous pressures, that of the left hand tending to lower the  head of the testicle, and that of the right elevating its tail, and the gland is being flexed upon the cord from which it is suspended, backwards and upwards. At the moment when the testicle forms an acute angle with the cord, the thumb of the left hand, resting upon the cord, comes into action to aid in the displacement by making a <em>point dâ€™appui</em> upon the inferior extremity of the organ, which now occupies the superior position, in such a</p></div> </div>
