<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With respect to the effect of the operation upon the character and disposition of the cow, these are easily illustrated in the movements of the nymphomaniac animal, which may be said to be constantly in a state of hysterical excitement. They seem to be in continual conditions of heat, running after and mounting other animals with which they may be in company, while never producing and giving no milk. They are always in a lean condition, and must remain a pecuniary loss to the dairyman. This manifestation of nymphomania is also met with in the mare, which, continually exhibiting signs of heat, becomes more or less dangerous on that account. In these cases the advantage of the operation of spaying cannot be overlooked. We have personal knowledge of several cases of this character, in which worthless and troublesome mares have been transformed into docile and valuable animals.</p></div> </div>
