It is necessary to be very careful to ascertain that they rest on the same level, in order to be secure against the possibility of untwisting. The ligature is then applied by passing three or four turns of it around the scrotal envelopes, immediately below the testicles, with not more than a sufficient degree of tightness to assure it against slipping off.</p></div> </div>
