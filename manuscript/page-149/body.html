The instruments required are a convex bistoury, one or two clamps, or a ligature, and an actual cautery, or the ecraseur most commonly in use. To these is sometimes added a pair of long forceps of peculiar construction, with jaws terminating in two spoon-shaped extremities, designed to grasp the testicle when placed high in the inguinal canal, or if only partly engaged in the ring. Prof. Degives divides the operation into five steps.</p></div> </div>
