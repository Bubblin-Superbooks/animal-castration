At first emollient applications, appropriate topical treatment, and a few points of cauterization, may be followed by a process of resolution. But in the event of their failure four modes of operation present themselves. These are, in their order, the application of the clamps; the ligature; the linear crushing or ecraseur; and cauterization. When the case is one of the extra-scrotal variety, the application of a ligature around the base of the peduncle, or removal by ecraseur, will be the simplest mode of treatment, unless there should exist a tendency to infiltration of the cord, in which case the manipulations to be followed become the same as those which are adapted to that of the deep or intra-scrotal form.</p><p>Fig. 25.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
