But they all work on the same principle, and effect the same object. With the single forceps but one cord can be treated at a time, but with the double instrument both cords may be secured at once, and may be divided and cauterized at one step. In this way the possibility of disturbing the eschar caused by the cauterization of one cord while manipulating the second, is quite obviated.</p></div> </div>
