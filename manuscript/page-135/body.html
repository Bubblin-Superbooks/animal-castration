By a change in the action of the hands, but a repetition of the same movement, the right hand now acting on the cord, while the left is applied to the testicle, the remaining portion of the motion of rotation is performed, and a complete torsion of the spermatic support accomplished. By repeating this action, of course as many turns of the cord as may be thought  necessary, can be secured, two, however, being generally found sufficient, although, in a few instances as many as four or five may be requiredâ€”never more than that. The length of the cord is the principal controlling circumstance. When these several steps have been completed with one testicle, their repetition is, of course, in order with the other. And when both have been treated, the consummation of the operation is called for by entering upon the fourth step, or that of the application of the ligature.</p></div> </div>
