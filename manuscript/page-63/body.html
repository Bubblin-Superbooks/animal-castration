An assistant, seizing it from before backwards between its open branches and strongly closing them, holds it firmly, without pulling upon the cord. The operator then grasps the cord with the moving forceps above the testicle, and a little below the point held by the assistant, leaving a small space between the instruments, and closing his own tightly, begins the movement of torsion, which he directs from left to right. For this he sometimes requires both hands, one of them keeping the instrument in place, while the other continues  the rotation as described. Ten or fifteen turns of the forceps are usually sufficient to complete the rupture of the cord, the artery, owing to its facility of elongation, being the last part to give way. The testicle  then separates, being held in the branches of the moving forceps; the fixing forceps are removed, and the</p></div> </div>
