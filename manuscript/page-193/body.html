The animal to be operated on is to be thrown on either side according to which cord is affected,  and an incision made through the envelopes as nearly parallel with the median line of the body as the case permits, when the tumor and the cord are carefully dissected and separated from their adhesions. If the tumor is suspended from the end of the cord there will be no difficulty in applying the clamp above it and upon a healthy portion</p></div> </div>
