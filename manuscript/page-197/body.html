It is for this reason that we agree with Prof. Bouley in considering the treatment of champignon by the linear crushing very much to be preferred.</p><p>_Ecraseur._—The steps of the operation with this instrument are similar to those required in the other methods already considered. The champignon is isolated from its surrounding parts, the chain is placed on the cord above the base of the tumor, and the amputation is completed by a slow pressure upon the cord, which, crushing it by degrees, permits its immediate removal. It must be done slowly, occupying from ten to twenty minutes for the complete separation of the champignon, according to the size of the tumor.
