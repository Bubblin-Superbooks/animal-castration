It must be remembered that in a majority of cases, the cause of this lesion is the presence of a foreign body in the wound, and that until it is removed, it is in vain to look for a cure. Prof. Bouley has reported a case in which the fistula was due to the presence of a pair of clamps over which the skin had almost entirely cicatrized.</p></div> </div>
