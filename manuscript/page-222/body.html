The original method was that of removal through the flanks, which, however, has fallen into disuse since the introduction of the process of Charlier, of removal through the vagina. This process is altogether to be preferred, as being safer, more consistent with scientific surgery, and in a word is the only one which it is proper to perform, so long as the capacity of the vagina permits the necessary manipulations to be performed.</p><p>Fig. 27.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
