Indeed, the mode of torsion may be said to have arisen principally as a modification of that of tearing, which is the older. In tearing, the cord was subjected to a certain amount of torsion <em>by the hand</em>, and then torn apart at a given  point in its length; while in the process of simple torsion, as properly performed, we obtain a division of the cord by twisting it <em>with instruments</em>, which enables the operator to effect the separation at a definitely determined spot.
