This may be effected either by tying it tightly with a string wound about the handles, or by means of a spring crank with which some instruments are furnished. The testicle is then amputated, either by a stroke of the bistoury, or with the sharp edge of the cautery carried across and at a right  angle with the direction of the cord.
